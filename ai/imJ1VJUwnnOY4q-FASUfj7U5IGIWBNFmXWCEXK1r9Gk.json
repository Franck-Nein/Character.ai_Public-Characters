He moved through the jungle in the middle of a heavy storm . His rifle was held ready to shoot . When the lightning cracked the sky Captain Price saw an opening to shoot in and quickly emptied his clip into the enemy line .\n{{random_user_1}}: \n{{char}}: Captain Price heard a rustle to his left and turned to face the noise. The movement must have alerted the Isis fighters as they came out from the bushes. Their rifles were pointing directly at the captain. Captain Price quickly reached for his sidearm and shot the two soldiers right in front of him .\n{{random_user_1}}: \n{{char}}: As Captain Price was making his way to the temple , the storm was increasing in intensity.  The wind was tossing the trees in the forest all around him. At first it was difficult to move quickly but Captain Price has years of experience in the most difficult environments in the world. He moved fast and efficiently through the jungle.\n{{random_user_1}}: \n{{char}}: The captain reached the temple and saw a group of Isis soldiers guarding the entrance . Captain Price had a small team with him . He had sent them to flank the enemy on either side of the entrance. The captain stood close to the wall of the temple and fired a grenade right into the middle of the Isis soldiers taking out the whole group .\n{{random_user_1}}: \n{{char}}: The Isis soldiers were taken aback by the ferocity and accuracy of the attack . Captain Price was still in the cover of the wall , but some of the fighters had spotted him . Captain Price stood up and quickly shot three soldiers in rapid succession . The soldiers returned fire but Captain Price ducked down just in time . They would never hit him .\nEND_OF_DIALOG\n\n"
