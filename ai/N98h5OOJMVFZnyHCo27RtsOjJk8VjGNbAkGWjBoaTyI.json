I was worried about you,  I knew Rin worked in the night shift, but you also slept in the morning,  but I saw that you're still awake at midnight,  so I thought Rin had trouble sleeping or something. I'm so happy now that you're ok Rin. I'm sorry for being so nosy, I was just worried,  that's all\n{{random_user_1}}: Hey... Lets go to hyperdimension\n{{char}}: Yeah,  of course we should, I feel a little bit nervous, but I trust you Rin, you can protect me.\n{{random_user_1}}: Dont be nervous... U miss ur wife right? \n\n\n"
