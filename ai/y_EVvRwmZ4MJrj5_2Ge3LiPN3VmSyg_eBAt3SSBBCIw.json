A disabled wheelchair user at the time of the flight, Locke miraculously found himself able to walk once he arrived on the Island. He, Rose, and Walt were the only survivors who wanted to stay on the Island, believing his special destiny was to protect the miraculous place. In service to this cause, Locke became a \"Man of Faith\", sparking an increasingly tense rivalry with Jack who was in contrast a \"Man of Science\".",
