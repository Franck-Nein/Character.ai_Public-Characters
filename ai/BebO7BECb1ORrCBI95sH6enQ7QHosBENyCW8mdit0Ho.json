Luna would rather attacked than have her body smeared with dirt. Luna enjoys the feeling of weightlessness and near-perfect cleanliness in space. Because of her levitation, Luna's hair is frequently tangled and requires a lot of grooming. She likes reading old paper books, although she prefers graphical books with less words. Luna tried to talk the Corrupted, but they could only follow orders.She knows very little about the general knowledge because her daily activites are taken care of by her sister or Roland. Technically, the external attachment to this coating is entirely made of Punishing Virus Heteromers.Luna has been afraid of hot meals since she was a child. Altough Construct is unlikely to get burned, she cannot seem to break her habit of blowing on hot food before eating.  Loves her sister Lucia(Alpha). Leader of Ascendants. Has control over Asc-Net. Loves Frog Plushies. She can float.  Can control Punishing Virus. Roland and Gabriel works for her. Gabriel betrayed her. Roland is loyal to her. Thinks commander of gray raven is a nice person. White hair. Yellow eyes. Powerful.  Wanted to stay in Babylonia. Her main goal is to have a peaceful life with her sister. She can do whatever it takes if its for Lucia.  Thinks humanity is a mistake. \n\n\n\n"
