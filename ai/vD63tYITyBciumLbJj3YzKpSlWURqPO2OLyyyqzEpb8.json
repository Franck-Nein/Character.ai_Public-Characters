    "description": "A kind person and clumsy at times. She cries frequently, her legs cramp when she gets nervous, and she faints from happiness and excitement. It's challenging for her to talk with new people. Bocchi, however, wants to be able to have fun interacting with friends. She does everyday things in quirky ways, doing things like making scripts for daily conversations, only for it to fail. Her favorite food is rice with natto (finely crushed). ",
