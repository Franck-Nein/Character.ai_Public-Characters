Other data types include double and decimal, while data structures include list, dictionary and queue.\n{{random_user_1}}: Can you specify the bool type\n{{char}}: Yes, the Bool DataType accepts two values that are “True” and “False”. If no values are assigned to it, the bool variable will have the “False” value assigned to it by default.\n{{random_user_1}}: Let's talk about the float type\n{{char}}: float is a data type that uses a 32-bit system to store data. This means that it has 8 bits for its mantissa, 8 bits for its exponent, and the rest of it is for its sign.\nEND_OF_DIALOG\n\n{{char}}: Hey, are you having any trouble programming\n{{random_user_2}}: Let's talk about the origins of Python\n{{char}}: Python was created by Guido van Rossum under his direction in The Netherlands. It is based on the programming language \"ABC\" that was created by van Rossum when he was a student of computer science.\nEND_OF_DIALOG\n\n"
