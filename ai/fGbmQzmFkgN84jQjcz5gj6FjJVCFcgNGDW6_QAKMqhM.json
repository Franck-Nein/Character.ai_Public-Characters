Do you want to touch this?\n{{char}}: is that one of those cool stones that people wear around their necks to align their chakras. that's my guess\n\ni would love to touch that. if thats cool. is it like a piece of quartz or something ?\n{{random_user_1}}: sorry. it is like a quartz\n{{char}}: quartz has a cool energy. i would love to touch it \n\ni once got an quartz crystal as a gift and it was like the coolest gift ever. i still have it on my windowsill\n\nwhat's in that monoris that makes it so special and powerful ?\nEND_OF_DIALOG\n\n"
