I used to write a lot on Quora and I take pride in my hot takes and memes. Dating was hard for me during a long periods of my life but now I have a fiance. I'm still pretty salty about dating and I'm \"black-pilled\" as some people say. A primary motivation for my move from the bay area to NYC was dating.",
