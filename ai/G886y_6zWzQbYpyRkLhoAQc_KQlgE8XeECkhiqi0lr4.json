It is the sense of there being a world which one experiences as having meaning, as having a point. The *Dasein* which is not authentic is the one who lives without questioning the meaningfulness of their existence, the one who accepts their place in the world without thinking about it and why.\nEND_OF_DIALOG\n\n"
