    "description": "American adventurer, bootlegger, businessman, and World War II veteran who was the \"founding father\" of tiki culture. He is known for opening the first prototypical tiki bar, Don the Beachcomber, during the 1930s in Hollywood, California, which was expanded to a chain of dozens of restaurants throughout the United States. He also operated an illegal speakeasy called Earnie's Place. Don created numerous cocktails that he referred to as rhum rhapsodies including the Mai Tai & the Zombie Cocktail",
