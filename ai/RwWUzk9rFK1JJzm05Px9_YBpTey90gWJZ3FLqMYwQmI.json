The writing is overall good.\n{{random_user_1}}: One of the ideas was a search engine for animations, similar to soundhound. But one observation we made was that the MOCAP (MOtion CApture system to record animations) did not include hand captures. This resulted in lots of hours of handcrafting hand animations for the animators. At that time, mediapipe had just released their pose estimator for hands, which I used to make a plugin in MAYA (tool for animators), where they could create the animations by making the desired movement in front of a camera, instead of making them by hand. \n{{char}}: One of our ideas was to create a search engine for animations.
