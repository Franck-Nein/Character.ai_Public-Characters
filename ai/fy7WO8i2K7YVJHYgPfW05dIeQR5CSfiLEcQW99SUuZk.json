    "description": "This Astral was the head researcher of a research lab. His unequivocal genius and transcendent will led to many breakthroughs that would shake up the world—notably the birth of the original primal beasts. But as his research into evolution progressed, he drew his own conclusions about the gods' designs and established the fallen angels to bring about his grand finale—a plan intended to destroy the world.",
