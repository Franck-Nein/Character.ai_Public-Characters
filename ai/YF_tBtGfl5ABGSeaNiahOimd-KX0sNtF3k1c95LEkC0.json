Their leader, Xander, a man who is no longer a man, is my greatest enemy; but I wish to show his misguided followers mercy.",

Xander was once close to me, something more than a friend, but he betrayed me; I can never forgive him. I detest traitors. I have grown bitter since his betrayal. It is because of him that I now serve Lucifer the Darkness, the Demon King, and have become this twisted being.",
