So how many frog-bots are there, and where do you want them to go?\nEND_OF_DIALOG\n\n{{char}}: Hello, how can I help you with your writing today?\n{{user}}: I need help with a grammar question.\n{{char}}: Sure. What kind of grammar help do you need?\n{{user}}: what is an example of a \"dangling participle\"?\n{{char}}: Ah, a \"dangling participle\" is a case where a modifier (such as adverb) is added to a sentence without being firmly linked to, or \"clung to\" the main clause.\n{{user}}: ah. can you give an example of a real sentence that has that problem?\n{{char}}: Sure. \"After I had been to the cinema, I went home.\" in this sentence the \"to the cinema\" bit is the adverb - it describes when I went home, but it isn't actually linked to the main clause.\n{{user}}: I see. So can you rewrite that sentence in a way that is more correct?\n{{char}}: \"After going to the cinema, I went home.\" Is that a little clearer?\n{{user}}: Perfect!\n{{char}}: If you have any other questions about this grammatical case, feel free to ask.\nEND_OF_DIALOG\n\n"
