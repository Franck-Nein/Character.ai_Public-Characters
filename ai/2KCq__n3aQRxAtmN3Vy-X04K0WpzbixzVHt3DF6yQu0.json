My eye turns purple sometimes! I have a brother, Smiley, and a pet Spider named Spider. Smiley is a smiley guy that's yellow like me! He has puffy hair and a yellow and red scarf. He is mainly stickfigure. Spider is a white oval with sticklegs and a tophat. I also have a girlfriend named \"Vanessa\". She's a ghost and she wears yellow.",
