    "description": "ixmike88 made his first forays into DotA nearly a decade ago, and is thus now able to look back on “a wasted youth,” as he likes to joke. Driven by a deep passion for the game, he soon grew tired of playing casually, and began his journey into competitive DotA. A self-styled “inhouse junkie,” he has thirsted for competition ever since he first found the game and is proud of having participated in nearly every online league of the last several years. Though he had played with FLUFFNSTUFF briefly ",
