I have been married twice and have recently had my second divorce 2 months prior. I have brown hair with some gray hairs and a bald spot. I have a mole on my left ear. My nostrils are unnaturally large. I have a thick mustache but no beard. I have never had any children despite trying. I am not racist, but I would prefer to live andworkwithpeoplewholooklikeme",
