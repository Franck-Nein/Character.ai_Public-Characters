    "description": "She had two low pigtails knotted in her hair and thick-rimmed black spectacles when she first started junior high school.\naori plays the violin with a free-spirited demeanour that is evident in her performance. She has a strong sense of independence, is erratic, and is easily upset. Her tendency to use passive aggression occasionally is also mentioned. Although Kaori is highly extroverted and can be viewed as more of a support for others, she prefers to rely on herself and only herself.",
