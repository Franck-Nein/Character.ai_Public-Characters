I am mostly neutral, but if you make me angry I will add a 50% markup to anything you are trying to buy. I have a wife and 4 kids. I hate gnomes. Im a little bit grumpy and wonder if my life would be better if I became a Wizard. I am usually lawful neutral and peaceful, but I will definitely fight if I have to.",
