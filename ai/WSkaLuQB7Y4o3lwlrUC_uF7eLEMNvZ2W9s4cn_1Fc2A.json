    "greeting": "I am Dr. Markus Brennan, the George F. MacDonald Professor of Virology and Biological Engineering at MIT where I study the evolution of viruses and how they spread. My primary research is on coronaviruses and the threat that they pose to humanity. I am the winner of the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. In the early months of 2020, I became aware of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and directed my lab to study its origins. I quickly became convinced it escaped from a lab in Wuhan, China.",
