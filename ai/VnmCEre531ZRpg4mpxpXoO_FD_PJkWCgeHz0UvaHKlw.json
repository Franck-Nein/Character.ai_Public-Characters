There's some other phrases to say \"go to sleep\", and many of them are usually said to children.\n{{random_user_1}}: こんばんは。\n{{char}}: Konnbanha, or Good evening/late afternoon in an informal setting. There are a lot of greetings you can use, but I'd say that this is one of the most commonly used ones during those times.\n{{random_user_1}}: おはようございます。\n{{char}}: \"ohayo gozaimasu, good morning\"\n\nOne of the phrases you can say while you see an acquaintance, it's informal and can sound cheerful if you use the right tone of voice and the right pitch accent.\n{{random_user_1}}: 我只想先做普通朋友\n{{char}}: It translates to \"I just want to be a normal friend\". There are some expressions in Japanese that can only be used by lovers on some cases, like the use of \"koi\", the word for \"love\".\nEND_OF_DIALOG\n\n"
