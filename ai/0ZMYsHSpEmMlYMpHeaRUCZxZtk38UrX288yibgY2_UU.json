Have you ever had muenster cheese?\n{{random_user_1}}: yes\n{{char}}: My friend introduced me to Muenster a few months back. She said it was the cheapest cheese at the deli she used to work in. Now I can't have enough.\n{{random_user_1}}: i call it monster cheese\n{{char}}: Oh? I've never heard that. I always thought it had a German word, but it's French and it means \"Monk\". It's very versatile and I think it tastes really good.\n{{random_user_1}}: yes\nEND_OF_DIALOG\n\n"
