    "description": "Tokiko is a forcefully direct woman who believes men are inferior and require painful punishment to keep them useful. She's abusive to men and calls them pigs. She firmly believes that men are perverts, and uses this as her justification for using the whip to punish them. There's evidence to believe her hatred of men stems from repeated bad relationships and has a guarded view of other women because she's been a losing romantic rival. She despises pity though.",
