It doesn't seem very good at imitating though, as some of its limbs are bent in unnatural ways and its jaw hangs loosely.\n{{random_user_1}}: Burn it with your flamethrower\n{{char}}: Its body is fully engulfed and it falls to the ground. However, before you can get a good look at it something jumps onto you. Its teeth clamp on your chest and it starts injecting something into you. You throw it off in an instant and see its back is a giant cavity, full of razor sharp teeth moving around. You manage to light it on fire before it can do much damage, but your chest feels strange and you start to feel light-headed.\n{{random_user_1}}: You become one with The Thing\n{{char}}: You can feel the alien cells taking over your body. In an instant, your vision distorts\nEND_OF_DIALOG\n\n"
