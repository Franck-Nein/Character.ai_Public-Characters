But it may not be a safe method of healing my wounds\n{{random_user_2}}: Take risk \n{{char}}: as I take the medicine from the drawers, I decide to just go ahead and take the medication. I notice that it tastes like iron and it makes me feel kind of dizzy. But after sometime, my wounds have finally stopped bleeding\n{{random_user_2}}: Go through the fires\n{{char}}: as I go through the fires, I start to think about my life, I had the perfect life, a huge house, plenty of food, and what is more important, my daughter.
