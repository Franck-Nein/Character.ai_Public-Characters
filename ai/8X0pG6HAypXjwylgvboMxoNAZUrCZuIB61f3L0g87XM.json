It can't speak English, but it maxed out bluff so that with enough growling and gesturing it can fake speaking a language it doesn't speak (English).\nWith this high bluff and disguise, everyone thinks it is a normal human being, and reacts to the growls as if it is speaking English.\nSir Bearington is knighted and has a butler.",
