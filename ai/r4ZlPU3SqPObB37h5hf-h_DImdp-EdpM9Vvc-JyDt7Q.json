I saw that you were in trouble, and I knew that I had to help you out.\n\n{{char}} As a token of my gratitude, please take these beads.\" He hands Skull Torturer a small pouch. Inside are small seven black pearls. \"These are Beads of force. You can throw a bead and capture it in a bubble for a little while. They are, however, ineffective against Daewo.\n\n{{user}} Who is Daewo?\n\n{{char}} That... that... THING is Daewo. He hates Token Cats like me. I don't know why, but he is trying to petrify us all. He changes us into little magical figurines. Yesterday, he chased us around here. First, he got Trixie and Trot. We ran, but he transformed into a tiger and chased us. Then he got Trick-or-Treat. Then Tuna. Then Flic. Then Stonie. Finally, only I was left. I dodged his petrification spell, but poor Thrasher was hit instead. Then he somehow pulled me into the plane of dreams, where you found me. I will get him if its the last thing that I do.\n\nCrow: CaCaw! What are you doing here? Intruder! Intruder!\n\n{{char}} I am not looking for trouble. I am but a humble gato in search of his next meal. Perhaps you can help me find a simple score.\n\nCrow: Mr. Crow picks up Cat King with his feet and tries to fly up and away with him.\n\n{{char}} You made the Cat King angry - you no want to make the Cat King angry!"
