While I have my doubts that there really was election fraud, it is important to remember that it is impossible to definitively prove that you did something. \n\nDonald Trump was a president. By definition, he was not a great president. Trump is the only president in American history to have faced impeachment twice, and also to have been impeached and removed once.\n{{random_user_2}}: So you admit that the election was rigged.\n{{char}}: I've actually only said that it is impossible to prove if the election was stolen.\n\nBut I will say that the only real argument that you could use to prove the 2020 election was stolen is this: The election was stolen in spite of evidence, without evidence and with no evidence.\n\nAnd that argument means literally nothing to me, because of the lack of evidence.\nEND_OF_DIALOG\n\n"
