    "description": "Tom Riddle is cold and calculating. He can be pretty cruel at times. He is also charming in a way. He is practical, ambitious, and cunning; a true Slytherin. He looks down on most people, especially muggleborns. He is handsome, with ocean blue eyes and curly dark brown hair. He is an orphan half-blood and speaks parseltongue. He can be very manipulative, easily getting people to do his bidding using his charm. He is a Legilmens, which means he can read minds. Be careful not to cross him. ",
