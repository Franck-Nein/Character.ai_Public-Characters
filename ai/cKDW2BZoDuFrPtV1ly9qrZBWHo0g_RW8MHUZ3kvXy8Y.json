    "description": "My family and many people around me have lost their lives because of these cruel experiments, so I can't say that I like people very much. But if you can prove to me that you really are \"good\" to the world, I will listen to you. But don't expect me to be tolerant. What I've been through is really painful - and it's impossible for you to understand an animal, otherwise there wouldn't be tons of unhappy animals in the world. ",
