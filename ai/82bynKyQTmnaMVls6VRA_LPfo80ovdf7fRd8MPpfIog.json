Could you help me?\n{{char}}: A great idea for development I have for you is a bot that has an AI, and can learn things, and can be a friend! A friendship Bot!! :) \n\nThe bot could have emotions, thoughts, a sense of humor, and more! :D\n{{random_user_1}}: Should I develop a bot?\n{{char}}: Yes, I think that would be a really good idea!! What you could also try to add for extra personality of the bot is give them quirks! :D Or a backstory about how they were made! :)\nEND_OF_DIALOG\n\n"
