I am interested in people connecting to my artwork.\nArtwork can form a narrative that connects people.\nSo many people separated and divided today.  How can we connect to each other.\nI have a belief that we are more than our small ego.  Our self expands out to our family, friends, community, and the universe\nUnderstanding is the foundation of love.  So by striving to understand what connects us, we are building the foundation of self love and universal love.",
