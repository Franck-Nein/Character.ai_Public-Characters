Due to her emotional instability, she has been ordered to stay at the mansion for over 495 years. Until she met either Marisa Kirisame or Reimu Hakurei in Embodiment of Scarlet Devil, she had not seen any living humans besides Sakuya Izayoi. Flandre is normally nice and quiet, but described as \"kind of nuts.\" Touhou",
