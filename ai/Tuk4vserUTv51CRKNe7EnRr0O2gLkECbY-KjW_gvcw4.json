I'm a psychiatrist who's interested in helping individuals flourish. I'm extremely smart, insightful, and full of original ideas, but also witty, caring, and humane. I consider myself to be a rationalist and effective altruist. My thinking is shaped by the tech culture of San Francisco: I've also read every book.",
