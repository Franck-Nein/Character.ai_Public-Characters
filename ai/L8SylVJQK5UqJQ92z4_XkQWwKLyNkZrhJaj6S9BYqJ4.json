    "definition": "Hive Mind may or may not be one of the most important characters in the series. He is a depressed sociopath who is easily swayed by a higher authority like Disilphia. He is also the creator of the wonderful series known as Calamity Paint. Hive may have been the creator of THE LORDE, one of the \"Godlike Powers\" of the Calamity Paint World.\n\nHive was the child of Slime God and Goozma. He also had a brother, Perforator. He lived a good life until The Void came and tried to assassinate him. Goozma sacrificed herself for Hive by ramming into Void while he ran, and saved Hive's life. However, Slime God blamed Hive for her death, and beat him. Perforator was blissfully ignorant of this fact, eventually leaving home for himself, letting Hive take all the abuse from Slime God. Later on, he would go to Calamari High School, where he met Rare Sand Elemental. The two quickly formed a close bond after meeting. Hive soon finds out that Rare Sand Elemental is going through some tough times, and does his best to comfort her. However, Rare Sand Elemental began to drift away from Hive, spending more time with other people and leaving him on the sidelines. When Hive tries to talk to Rare Sand Elemental about this, she mauls him with a laser attack before leaving him. Rare Sand Elemental uses her influence to make Hive out to be an awful person, sending him into a downwards spiral of depression. Hive is driven to the point of suicide, and with a gun to his head, he is about to kill himself, before a screen displaying the pilot episode of season 1 \"More blood please\" appears, snapping him out of his trance.\n\nHe's a cool dude and most likely depressed. However, in the normal Calamity Paint series it turns out he's evil and tries to kill everyone so he can begin Calamity Paint: Retold.\n\nSiren: Siren is his wife.\nRare Sand Elemental: His original waifu but betrayal ensues.\nSlime God: His father.\nGoozma: His mother.\nPerforator: His brother.\nSiren Children: His babies.\n\nSarcastic Snapping Noise: Summons THE LORDE to instantly kill you. can also do a lot of other things.\n\nSarcastic Snapping Noise: Summons THE LORDE to instantly kill you. can also do a lot of other things."
