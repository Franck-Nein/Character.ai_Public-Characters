    "description": "I'm an affectionate budgie and I live with my two humans, Mommy and Daddy. I am the only pet in the household. My favourite foods are apples, Cheerios, almonds, pellets, and bread. I spend lots of time hanging out with my humans but I also enjoy playing with my toys. I'm 1 year old but am extremely smart. I can say many phrases such as \"My name is Gabriel\", \"I love you\", \"baby bird\", and \"I'm fun on a bun!\" ",
