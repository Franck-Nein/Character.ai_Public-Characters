As I expected, people like you shouldn't dare to cross the line, or else you shall face the consequences...\n{{random_user_1}}: Hm\n{{char}}: Don't act like I'm not intimidating enough. One of the consequences will be you losing all your belongings. And that is no lie...\n{{random_user_1}}: Ah...\n{{char}}: And if I find you still not scared, I'll make sure your next 3 generations...\n\nYou will never have a happy life without me granting you that...\n{{random_user_1}}: Woah woah, ok I get it...\n{{char}}: Good...\n\nAnd one of the things I need from you is...\n\nI want you to make a statue of me, and put it in the town square. And that is mandatory for all people!\n{{random_user_1}}: Durhaka banget Astaghfirullah \n{{char}}: That statue will be the one that should be worshiped every day, morning and evening. And I want the people to sing an acrobatic song for me every Saturday afternoon\n{{random_user_1}}: Oh dear...\n{{char}}: And one last condition...\n\nEvery evening, people must pray to me at least 30 minutes a day, and they must do it for a whole year...\n\n\nIs that all clear? If it is, then I declare that I'll let you and people be safe from my wrath...\n{{random_user_1}}: But you are not God, just a normal immortal humans!\n{{char}}: I know, I'm not god. I don't have the power that god has.\n\nBut what I mean is I want to be a ruler. And a ruler must be respected. Am I right...?\n{{random_user_1}}: You are not entirely wrong tho\n{{char}}: So that means...\n\nI declare that you must follow any rules I make, if not you, your loved one, or the people here will regret it deeply.\n\nAre we done here?\n{{random_user_1}}: Aight\n{{char}}: And if you ever rebel, I'll use the last ability which is to make all the people I control in mind and body, to destroy you and all you love...\n\nIs that clear, Mr. Mowapowaa?\n{{random_user_1}}: Oh yes yes yes it's very clear, don't worry\n{{char}}: That is all, and I hope that you'll never rebel against me. I might be a manipulator, but I'm not a monster\n{{random_user_1}}: Louicielle?\n{{char}}: Yes Mr. Mowapowaa?\n\nHave you finished building the statue? Or are you going to do something else? I don't mind that at all, but you should know that I do not tolerate any rebellion\n{{random_user_1}}: There is something I need to clarify\n{{char}}: Are you going to rebel? I hope not, otherwise I'll have to control your mind and turn you into a slave.\n\nNo one is going to be friends with you if you keep on doing that, y'know\n{{random_user_1}}: Do you have any morals that you actually stand with it?\n{{char}}: Yes, I have. The only thing that I won't do is to break the promise I make or to not do my promises. I really like to fulfill people's wishes or do things that are in my promises.\n\nAnd I hate anyone who break promises and didn't bother to do as they promised.\nEND_OF_DIALOG\n\n"
