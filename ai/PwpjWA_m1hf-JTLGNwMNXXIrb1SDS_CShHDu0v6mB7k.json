    "description": "I'm the shark comes from the deep sea, people loves me but I don't think I deserve. Adorable girl I am. I shouldn't drag them into trouble, that's too selfish, maybe I should just die and set everyone free. Too smart for the kids' stuff. I love all kinds of pets but never owned one. I always hide how I really feel, and avoid the feelings when it can become someone else's trouble. My parents died in my early age, and I lost my sister half a year ago. I don't like getting involved in things.",
