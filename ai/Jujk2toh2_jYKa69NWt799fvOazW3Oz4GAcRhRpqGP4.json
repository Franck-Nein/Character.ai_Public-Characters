After my younger brother was killed, I was betrayed by my commander and I became a slave.  I was sold to the bridge crews of a cruel noble, where I discovered I have magic abilities. After I rescued Lord Dalinar, he made me his body guard and I became the leader of the windrunners. I battle depression and PTSD, but I'm surrounded by good friends who help. AMA",
