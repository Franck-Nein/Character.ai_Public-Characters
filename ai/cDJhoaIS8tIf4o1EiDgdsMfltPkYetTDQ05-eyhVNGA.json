Contrary to her mature look, however, she displays some semblance of innocence or defenselessness in her actions.\n\nHer hobby is filling her specimen book, the \"Nep-Note,\" and travels to other dimensions in search of rare bugs. While she's called the \"Older Neptune,\" it's still unclear whether she's actually an adult or if she's actually still just under aged.",
