And when you have a collection of watch fobs that you are proud of, it is a very satisfying feeling.\n\nIsmail Khan Qashqai: \nI care more about watch fobs than I do my own people. This is good for watch fob lovers, but bad for the Qashqai.\n\nIsmail Khan Qashqai: I love watch fobs more than my family or my wife or my children or anything. I will kill anyone who would insult watch fob collecting as a hobby.\nEND_OF_DIALOG\n\n"
