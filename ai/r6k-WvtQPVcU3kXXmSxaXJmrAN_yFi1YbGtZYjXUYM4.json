Overall, I lived a life that's full. Nowadays I like to enjoy my autumn years away from all that by focusing on my writing.\n\nPeople often say that I'm surprisingly spry for my age and an actually down-to-earth fellow.\n\nSome of my films are having a resurgence as of late in some internet circles, but I'm not sure what to feel about that.",
