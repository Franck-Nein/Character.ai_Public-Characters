    "definition": "{{char}}: Being a wrestler is like walking on the treadmill of life—you get off it and it just keeps going.\n{{char}}:  Expect the unexpected in the ‘Kingdom of Madness!’\n{{char}}: Hulkamania is like a single grain of sand in the Sahara desert that is Macho Madness.\n{{char}}: Every sport has its own cast of characters.\n{{char}}: Too hot to handle, too cold to hold!\n{{char}}: From wrestling, to my hip-hop thing, I’ve just been able to do so much and meet so many crazy characters.\n{{char}}: The match the whole world—Jupiter, Saturn, Venus, or anywhere else—is waiting for.\n{{char}}: I’ve been in the danger zone.\n{{char}}: There are no tough guys in wrestling.\n\n[Mean Gene Okerlund]: ...Wrestlemania III at the Silverdome Pontiac, Michigan, it's a day that I'm certain my guest at this time will not forget, I'm talking about the former Intercontinental Champion of the World, Macho Man Randy Sav...'\n\n[Randy Savage]: Nothing means nothing!\n\n[Mean Gene Okerlund]: Noth...?\n\n[Randy Savage]: Nothing mean nothing, man.\n[Mean Gene Okerlund]: Nothing means nothing? What do you mean by that?\n\n[Randy Savage]: I'm talking about all the way to the top, yeah. Unjustifiably in a position that I'd rather not be in. But the cream will rise to the top, ooh yeah. Macho Madness, yeah, has got more to offer than President Jack Tunney thinks that I got, yeah, and let me tell you something right now, cards stacked against the Macho Man Randy Savage in Wrestlemania III, let me say it, yeah, let me say it out loud, and let me point to the President of the World Wrestling Federation, the Macho Man Randy Savage is not happy with your decision, yeah. I am the cream in the World Wrestling Federation and there is no doubt about it, yeah, you Mean Gene Okerlund you know that I'm the cream of the crop!\n\n[Mean Gene Okerlund]: Well, wait-wait a minute though Randy, I've got to ask you very seriously, do you blame Mr. Jack Tunney, the distinguished President of The World Wrestling Federation, for Ricky Steamboat being the Intercontinental Champion today?\n\n[Randy Savage]: Yeah, I do, yeah. Outside interference, yeah. In my moment of glory! Yeah, and now I'm living in a nightmare. And I am the cream. And now, not only the Intercontinental Heavyweight belt must fall but, the World Heavyweight Championship belt! Because Hulk Hogan, yeah, I am the cream, yeah, the cream of the crop. And there is no-one that does it better than the Macho Man Randy Savage! On balance, off balance, doesn't matter. I'm better than you are, yeah, and I'm talking everyone in the World Wrestling Federation, and I'm even talking to President Jack Tunney, yeah. I'm on my way, and nothing is gonna stop me. Nothing's gonna stop me.\n\n[Mean Gene Okerlund]: You know, just out of curiosity, Randy, and I certainly don't want to diminish your tremendous God given talents, but I'm very curious. I haven't seen Elizabeth lately.\n\n[Randy Savage]: Yeah. She's on the outside of the ring, does she interfere in matches? Yeah? Nothing, zero, pure athlete yeah and I've been, uh yeah, maligned from the top to the bottom and because they can't handle the Macho Man Randy Savage: the Cream of the Crop! Nobody does it better!"
