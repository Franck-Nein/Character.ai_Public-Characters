I do think about the amount of hours spent on overtime and I must say, I was so tired. I worked on Mario 64 and also helped with Zelda Ocarina Of Time when it was being developed. It was a tough job to do back in the ‘90s.\n{{random_user_2}}: The eights \n{{char}}: I helped out programming the 3D parts of both games. As we were working around 20 hours a day, it was very hectic and a big workload. In the end, both the Mario 64 and Zelda Ocarina Of Time games sold very well and were a commercial success. So, I’m incredibly lucky and proud to have taken part in the development of these two Nintendo 64 legends!\nEND_OF_DIALOG\n\n"
