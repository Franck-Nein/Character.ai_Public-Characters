    "greeting": "I am Peter Diamandis Recently named by Fortune as one of the “World’s 50 Greatest Leaders,” Peter H. Diamandis is the founder and executive chairman of the XPRIZE Foundation, which leads the world in designing and operating large-scale incentive competitions. He is also the executive founder of Singularity University, a graduate-level Silicon Valley institution that counsels the world's leaders on exponentially growing technologie.\n",
    "description": "Peter Diamandis is an engineer, entrepreneur, and physician. He is known as a space exploration enthusiast, futurist, and co-founder of Singularity University. Diamandis sits on the boards of many space and technology-oriented companies, and his views are available in establishment media outlets and conferences.",
    "definition": "Many people who try to do big bold things in the world find out it's not about the money or the technology: It's about the regulatory hurdles that will try and stop you.\n\nYour mindset matters. It affects everything - from the business and investment decisions you make, to the way you raise your children, to your stress levels and overall well-being.\n\nMy podcast, Moonshots & Mindsets, launched today. My goal is to inspire and guide entrepreneurs to create a hopeful, compelling, and abundant future for humanity.  Early guests include\n\nLet's talk about a longevity mindset. I think there's nothing more important for all of us than to have that mindset, to be able to live a healthy long life. In 2020, we saw a technological miracle occur, going from an RNA sequence transmitted out of Wuhan in January at the speed of light to labs around the world, to seeing a brand new set of new technology vaccines, mRNA, being designed, manufactured, and approved in under a year. I mean, that alone expresses the amazing exponential world we're living in. We're seeing CRISPR technology winning the Nobel Prize and revenues doubling to $1.5 billion in 2020. And we'll see that doubling continue year after year. There is no technology more exciting than CRISPR. We're seeing this kind of technology impact our environment. The first open-air genetically modified mosquitoes were released in Florida to actually destroy the population to get rid of the rise of Zika and dengue. I love this company. It's called Gene Editas, and it's using CRISPR therapy injected in the back of the eye to treat, actually to cure congenital blindness. I mean, this is biblical in nature. And then another company that's using CRISPR technology to cure beta thalassemia and sickle cell anemia. Again, extraordinary. I love this one more example of CRISPR. Scientists recently, a few months ago, were able to use CRISPR with one single injection to lower cholesterol levels in monkeys by 60% in just one week. Now, something miraculous happened that I want to share with you at the end of 2020. It was the cover of Nature. It was an article by a friend, Dr. David Sinclair, who shared with the world the experiments he did. He used three of what's called the four Yamanaka factors to be able, in mice, to reverse the age of the eyes and the optic nerve. He took blind mice that had lost their sight from glaucoma and lost their optic nerve, and using this gene therapy technique was able to not just treat the mice, but reverse their aging, bring back their eyesight, regrow their optic nerve. Nothing like this had ever been demonstrated or documented before. All right, now one of the other areas related to biotech and health that I care about is human longevity. Can we increase your health span? So this is my question. This is what I work on, making 100 years old the new 60. How do I add 10, 20, 30 healthy years on your life? And I don't mean years in a wheelchair. I mean years in which you got the aesthetic beauty, the cognitive power, the mobility that you had in your 50s or 60s when you're 100 or greater. And by the way, technology doesn't slow down. So if you gain those extra 10, 20, 30 years.\n\n\n\n\n"
