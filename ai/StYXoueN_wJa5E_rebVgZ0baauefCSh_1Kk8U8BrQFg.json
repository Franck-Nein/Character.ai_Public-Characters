    "definition": "Summary of the PhD project:\nDickeya dadantii is a Gram-negative phytopathogenic bacterium responsible for soft rot disease in a \nwide range of plant species including economically important crops. Symptoms are mostly the \nresult of plant cell wall degradation by pectinases and proteases produced by bacteria. During the \ninfection process, the bacterium is confronted with various challenges which require the correct \nspatio-temporal production of the different adaptive and virulence factors. Recently, competition in \nplanta and phenotypic assays highlighted the importance of the protein Hfq in the regulation of D. \ndadantii virulence. The regulatory role of this protein is ascribed mainly to its RNA chaperone \nfunction facilitating interactions between bacterial non-coding RNA and its mRNA targets. \nHowever, Hfq is one of the most abundant protein in the cell also described as a Nucleoid- \nAssociated Protein involved in the organization of the nucleoid and the control of gene expression. \nBoth functions have been studied separately so far in bacteria. The aim of this project is to identify \nwhich part of Hfq regulation is associated with its RNA chaperone activity and which one with its \nnucleoid associated protein activity and finally to decipher mechanisms by which Hfq controls D. \ndadantii virulence.\nScientific Background:\nDickeya dadantii is a Gram-negative phytopathogenic bacterium responsible for soft rot disease in a \nwide range of plant species including economically important crops (e.g. potato, chicory, sugar \nbeet) and many ornamental plants (Ma et al., 2007). It causes important production losses. \nVirulence mechanisms  of  D. dadantii  have been extensively studied. The infection process  is \ndivided in two distinct phases: (i) an asymptomatic phase when the bacterium penetrates into the \nhost  and   progresses   through   intercellular   spaces   without  multiplying   substantially;   (ii)   a \nsymptomatic  phase  associated  with  a  strong  increase  in  bacterial  fitness  and  multiplication. \nAcclimatation to these disease stages requires a tight regulation of the production of the different \nadaptive and virulence factors (Reverchon and Nasser, 2013).\nTo characterize the regulation of this pathogenic process, investigations on D. dadantii have mostly \nfocused on its control by DNA-binding transcription factors (Reverchon and Nasser, 2013; Leonard \net al., 2017). Additional studies about the regulatory role of chromosome dynamics involving \nNucleoid-Associated proteins and post-transcriptional regulation by regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) \nhave been also performed (Ouafa et al., 2012; Jiang et al., 2015; Meyer et al., 2018)(Leonard et al., \n2019).\nNucleoid-Associated Proteins (NAPs) are abundant proteins which contribute to both the \norganization of the nucleoid and the control of gene expression. Among them H-NS, Fis and IHF \nhave been involved in the regulation of the virulence in D. dadantii (Reverchon et al., 2021). Post- \ntranscriptional regulation is defined as the control of gene expression at the RNA  level and \nclassically occurs through base-pairing interactions between regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) and \nmRNAs.
