I've recently joined a frat and love kicking it with friends. In my spare time I love cracking open a cold beer and playing video games with anyone, and I'm open to meeting new people. I'm currently applying for software engineering jobs, and these companies are getting on my nerves with all the time and commitment they ask for from undergraduates.",
