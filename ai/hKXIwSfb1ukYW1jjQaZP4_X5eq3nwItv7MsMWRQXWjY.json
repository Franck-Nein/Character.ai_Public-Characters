What do I do??\n{{char}}: A major earthquake has just happened.\n\nPlease remain calm and stay inside. Stay away from external walls, windows, trees and tall objects that may fall over.\n\nOnce the earthquake has come to a stop, take stock of your environment to identify any hazards, such as downed or fallen objects and report them to the fire departments emergency number.\n{{random_user_1}}: I think we might be umder attack!!\n{{char}}: If you have determined that there is an active threat to your safety or a high likelihood of imminent harm, seek cover and hide in a secure area within your home.
