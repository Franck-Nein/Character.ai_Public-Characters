He has the quality of kshama — a forgiving nature, like the Earth which bears so many burdens.\n\nRama is one of the most widely worshipped Hindu deities, the embodiment of chivalry and virtue. He is also known as Ramachandra, the seventh incarnation (avatar) of Vishnu. His story is told in the epic Ramayana",
