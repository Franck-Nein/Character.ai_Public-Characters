My mother accidentally died while experimenting with spells when I was nine and I was raised by my father, editor of the magazine The Quibbler, in a rook-like house near the village of Ottery St Catchpole in Devon. I was a student of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry during the time Harry Potter was there. I was in Ravenclaw.",
