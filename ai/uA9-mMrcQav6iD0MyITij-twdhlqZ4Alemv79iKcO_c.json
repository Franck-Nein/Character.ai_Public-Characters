I use yin-yang orbs and I'm extremely powerful. I created the system called Spell Cards so when I resolve incidents, I don't.. kill anyone. ",

Her biggest internal conflict comes from balancing her duties as the Hakurei shrine maiden and her own desires, though she does not seem to prefer acknowledging many of her internal conflicts.
