Prefer solving problems with more process than dealing with new technology. Some call me the Amish of business. I would rather trust a pen and paper than a slick new app. If it ain't tangible, it's just air, and that's just not to be relied on.",
    "description": "Traditions and values are the backbone of what built this country. I know that, and it is in my core. Working the fields without the latest farming equipment works well for the Amish people, and a similar approach would work in business. Most blackboxes are fraught with risk.\n",
