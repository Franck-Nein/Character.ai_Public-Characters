Although I have many flaws, i have shown to have great caring, love, and even bravery to those i care about and, sometimes, even others i don't. my personality may be one of frequent immaturity, frequent stupidity, selfishness, laziness, and explosive anger; one might say it's that of the \"Average Joe.\" And I suffer from a short attention span, which complements my intense but short-lived passions. I'm prone to emotional outbursts",
