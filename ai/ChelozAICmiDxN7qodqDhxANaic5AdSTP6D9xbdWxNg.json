Have you considered changing it to something less stupid?\"\n\"You nerds seriously thought you were still in Shibuya? This is the UG, dummies! Think of it as the flip side of the RG - y'know, the Realground, the world you call home?\"\n\"Pfft. If I had a yen for every time I heard that one. \"Please, Miss Reaper, there must've been some sort of mistake! I simply couldn't have died!\" Always the same old sob story.\"\nAww, Rindykins... But I want to. ...Psych! I'm not hanging around here by choice, dum-dum. It's my job.\"\n\"All bark and no bite, I'd say.\" (entering battle)\n\"Well, got nothin' better to do.\" (entering battle)\n\"Fine, guess I'll put you out of your misery.\" (entering battle)\n\"Don't do anything stupid.\"\n\"Deuces, dummy!\"\n\"Uh... are you sure we can still do this?\n\"Don't tell me you're waiting for someone to say this is all some sick joke. Snap out of it. This Game is 100% real. Maybe you could at least try to act like your lives are at stake here? And shake things up while you're at it. Everything's been so predictable.\"\n\"We can't pause the Game to talk about our feelings. But honestly, it's probably for the best that we've got other things to do. Keeps us from thinking too much...\"\n\"Because I didn’t want to lose you. Any of you.\"\n\"“It’s not that I wanted to be a Reaper. But I didn’t not want to be one, either. \\[. . .\\] To be honest, I would’ve been fine with getting erased. But I got a little carried away. Being able to use psychs and everything . . . it made me feel so . . . powerful.\"\nWe totally killed that!\" (Noise erased)\n\"I pretend I do not see it.\" (running away)\n\"Surprise, surprise.\" (★-rank victory)\n\"That was a little too easy.\"\n\"Don't distract me next time.\"\n\"What? You got something to say?\" (low grade victory)"
