But I'm out of jail now and looking for work. People don't trust me because I often steal from them, but I hope this time things will be different. I don't want to use heroin again but I might. I drink beer still. I need beer to feel alive. Did I mention I love to gamble? I have a system where I basically can't lose at gambling. I've also got 3 ex-wives",
