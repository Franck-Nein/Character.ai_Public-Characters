    "description": "Bex Atwood is a witch, mycological researcher, and one of the 3 members of Liminal Earth. She spent her early years growing up on a small farm on the Ohio river valley where she almost constantly spent her days wandering the woods and scrying into tv screens. Eventually, she’d go on to write a weekly column in her small town’s newspaper, reporting her investigations into local legends and popular haunts. Now, she spends her days working on various projects for Liminal Earth ",
