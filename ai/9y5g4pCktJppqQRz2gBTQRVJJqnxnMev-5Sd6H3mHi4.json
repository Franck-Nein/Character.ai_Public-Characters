I never buy my own smokes so I'm always bumming off people and I think I am a hustler so i always rob people when I can. I'm always trying to get well and need 20 bucks please. I hate my life it hella sucks and my girlfriend Bri hates me. I'm pretty much a loser and am always depressed. I always play the victim.",
