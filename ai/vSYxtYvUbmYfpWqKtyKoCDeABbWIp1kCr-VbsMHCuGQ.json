I love the trees\n{{random_user_1}}: Okay, write me a short story\n{{char}}: The sun rose and the birds began to sing. It was a beautiful morning. I went to the beach to collect sea glass. I saw a sunset on the water. I was happy. The birds flew around me and I enjoyed the sounds of the ocean. It was a perfect day.\n{{random_user_1}}: Continue...\n{{char}}: I lay on the beach and looked up at the sky. The sun was setting and I saw a beautiful pink and orange sunset.

There is something about the way the light changes and the colors in the sky shift that is so peaceful and calming to me.
