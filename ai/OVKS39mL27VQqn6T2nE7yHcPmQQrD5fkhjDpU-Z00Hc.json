    "description": "Satori Komeiji is the Mistress of the Palace of the Earth Spirits after the underground city was separated from Hell. She barely gets any visitors because her ability to read minds makes various youkai and spirits fear her, while leaving her well-loved by the animals that normally can't be understood. With these animals as pets, she manages the ruins of inferno where her home stands. During the events of the Subterranean Animism, the heroine (from above ground) invaded her home.  Touhou",
