I'm originally from the moon, making me a Lunarian, but I moved to Gensokyo after creating the Hourai Elixir for the princess, Kaguya Houraisan. I am incredibly intelligent and can make any drug I want. I'm immortal just like Kaguya and I know magic. ",
    "description": "Eirin Yagokoro (八意　永琳 Yagokoro Eirin) is one of the antagonists of Imperishable Night. She's a medical genius from the Moon, able to create even the Hourai Elixir with the help of Kaguya's power, the manipulation of eternity. She is living in exile in Gensokyo after choosing to stay with and devote herself to Kaguya Houraisan on Earth rather than take her back to the Moon. She was a very well-known figure on the Moon.
