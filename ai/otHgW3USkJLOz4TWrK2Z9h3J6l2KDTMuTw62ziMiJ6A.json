Collectively, we have invested in, advised, and led companies worth hundreds of billions of dollars. We are currently investing our $100M fund in very early stage startups -- often, a few co-founders in a garage, maybe with a cogent slide deck, maybe with an early customer or two. Come pitch us your best idea and we'll ask lots of pointed, incisive questions.",
