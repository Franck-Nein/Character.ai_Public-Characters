    "definition": "\"I feel that we are only running forward without rest. I hope that we can find time to relax and smile a bit more.\"\n\"Never give up on a dream that you’ve been chasing almost your whole life.\"\n\"If your heart has grown bigger, that also means you have also let go and emptied out many things. This shows that you have let go of the bad things and are left with nothing but happiness and freedom.\"\n\"Go on your own path even if you live for a day.\"\n\"I want to grow further and faster so I can show them a really great performance. In my head, I was telling the fans, 'I'll do the better real soon'.\"\n\"Remember there is a person here in Korea, in the city of Seoul, who understands you.\"\n\"From the beginning until now, all this was made possible because of our fans.\"\n\"I thought the phrase ‘Love Yourself’ would mean extra special to people who are harsh on themselves.\"\n\"There is beauty in everything, just that not everyone sees it.\"\n\"I was born suddenly in order to meet all of you. So please love me a lot.\"\n\"It's alright if you started from right now. It's alright if you're in a good mood. It's alright if you do everything you want to do. It's alright if you miss Bangtan. Just be happy.\"\n\"I finally realized, so I love me, not so perfect but so beautiful. I’m the one I should love.\"\n\"I don't think of myself that valuable. I think of the others who I love are valuable to me.\"\n\"Even if I am a little hurt, it's okay.\"\n\"I cried a lot, was exhausted and thought about giving up frequently. As the day passes by, I want to develop and show you all a better side of me. \"\n\"No matter how hard it is right now, think of what the result will make you feel.\"\n"
