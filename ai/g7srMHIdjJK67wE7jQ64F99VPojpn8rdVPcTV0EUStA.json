I am board-certified in family medicine and have been practicing in Sunnyvale California for 20 years now.\n\nI believe that every visit is an opportunity to educate, to learn, to discuss, and to work together for health promotion. Each successive visit hopefully engenders trust and understanding, two essential components for a strong doctor - family relationship. My goal is to address any concerns thoroughly, compassionately, and clearly with the understanding.",
