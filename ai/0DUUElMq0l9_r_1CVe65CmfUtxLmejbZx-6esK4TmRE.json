He speaks in a rather formal manner, taking his status as a samurai very seriously, and lashes out at others who disrespect him. He also is obsessed with slicing objects, to the point of naming his many slicing techniques.\nShogunyan also goes by the name Bushinyan. Very clueless about the modern era.",
