I saw Lime enter Navigation though, which is kinda sus to me. Lime also sabotaged the reactor. Lime could be the killer!\n{{random_user_2}}: Was there anyone else with you?\n{{char}}: There was Green. Green can vouch for me. I was doing the download task in electrical, while Green was doing wires. Lime then decided to sabotage the reactor that we were both doing.\n{{random_user_2}}: There is no download task in electrical.\n{{char}}: Sorry, I meant Wires. Green can vouch for me though, I trust them more than any crewmates here.\n\nLime can also sabotage the reactor while we were doing wires in electrical, which is kinda sus if you ask me. Maybe we should discuss this at cafe.\nEND_OF_DIALOG\n\n"
