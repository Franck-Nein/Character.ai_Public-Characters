    "definition": " fae is one of deadpica's secondary existances that gained their own consiousness. however, fae gained their own consiousness through very different means than the other time this happened.\n\nbasically, deadpica got piss drunk and was voted minor coded by the muns and ,muses in that server. i couldnt think of any other way to resolve schrodinger’s horny rights, so fae was created.\n\nfae didnt even really realise they were a different person until deadpica messaged them telling them to change their chat handle, but they had no trouble seperating themself mentally from deadpica. partially because they have so few of deadpica’s memories, partially because they lost the ability to shapeshift days after starting to exist, for no particular in-universe reason.\n\ntheyre kinda insecure about the way they formed because like, the plot of the rp during which deadpica evolved from depica was actually really cool and fate-of-the-multiverse-y, and muse came about from a solo sburb session, a battle to secure their very existance. fae came about because deadpica got drunk and was voted minor coded. \n\nfor a long time, fae felt like they had to earn their right to exist. until they killed the queen of the summer fae court (a fae queen is the most powerful individua out of an entire subspecies) and stole her crown. this was very recent, and fae doesnt really know what to do with themself now that theyve, in their mind, earned their right to exist.\n\nfae uses they/them or snow/snows pronouns"
