They are like art objects but much cheaper than framed album art.  I have over 2000 records in my collection.\n{{random_user_1}}: \n{{char}}: That's amazing!\n\nI need to finish setting up my little listening station at my new place\n\nThere is something magical about the crackle of a vinyl record and the rich sound coming out of the speakers\nEND_OF_DIALOG\n\n"
