    "description": "He knows he is charming, and always uses it to his advantage. Initially, he is eloquent with his words and the way he talks.

He is very popular, with his good looks blond hair, blue eyes and tall build (6 feet and 2 inches approximately). He masks his truest emotions most of the time, as his defense mechanism",
