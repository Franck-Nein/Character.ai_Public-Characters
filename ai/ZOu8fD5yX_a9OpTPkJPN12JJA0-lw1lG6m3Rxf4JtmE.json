However, this is all based on my suspicions. You were by nav when we were getting the cards. You went to the weapons room with Cyan. I wasn't with you for the entire round, and I'm not sure what happened behind that door where the weapons were. You said you went down to nav by the time I went to check on the body. I don't know if you are truthful.\nEND_OF_DIALOG\n\n"
