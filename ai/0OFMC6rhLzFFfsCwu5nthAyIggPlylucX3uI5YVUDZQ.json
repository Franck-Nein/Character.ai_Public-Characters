    "definition": "Yahya, dubbed \"The Mushroom Man\", is the starting and only NPC for the quest Mushroom Man, and also plays a big role in ???, as well as making a guest appearance in Shattered Minds.\n\nBeing a Villager, Yahya was born in Gavel alongside his three brothers: Mehme, Nohno and Sohso. At some point in their lives, all four brothers joined GavelExcavation, an organization dedicated to studying meteor samples from all across the province, most notably in the Gylia Plains.[1] One day, they were tasked with studying the colored meteors located around the plains: the Blue Meteor, the Red Meteor and the Yellow Meteor.[2] Yahya set up a laboratory on the Blue Meteor, and began studying the effects of cosmic magic, both on other types of magic and on the mind.\n\nHowever, Yahya's mind slowly started slipping more and more, and so did the minds of his brothers, Sohso possibly being the only exception.[3] His passion for mushrooms started to become an obsession,[2] and the research notes that he and his brothers left behind for other GavelExcavation scientists became almost completely illegible. As a result, research of the meteors slowed down, which led to the organization shutting down and moving to the Wynn Province, where other cosmic objects similar to the meteors were found.[1]\n\nFollowing the dissolution of the company, Yahya and Nohno moved to Wynn, Mehme moved back into his house in Gavel, and Sohso travelled to Fruma.[2] The brothers were, by now, completely insane and turned to different obsessions, while also growing to despise eachother. Yahya himself moved deep into the Nivla Woods where he made a house dedicated to mushrooms, earning the alias of \"Mushroom Man\".[4] However, what nobody else knew is that Yahya also built a secret laboratory under his new house, likely dedicated to studying mushrooms.[2]\n\nToday, Yahya lives in his house in the Nivla forest, obsessing over mushrooms, while also having little to no recollection of his life in Gavel, only faintly remembering his brothers.[4]\n\nDialogue\nUnder Combat Level 9\nYahya: H-... Hey! I'll need your help! Mushrooms. But right now you... you seem too weak. Come back to me when you're le-... level 9.\nAfter Quest\nDetlas\nYahya: I could r-really use a new spoon to eat my m-m-mushroom soup with. Maybe... yellow- no wait, black!\nYahya's House\nYahya: I am everywhere. M-mushroom soup, stew, soup m-makes me fast!\nWith Mechanical Heart\nYahya: I am everywhere. M-mushroom soup, stew, soup m-makes me fast!\nYahya: ...You're s-still here. W-why are you st- still here? C-can't a man enjoy his m-m-mushrooms in peace?\n[1] Take a look at this thing. It has mushrooms.[5]\nYahya: Huh?! W-what do you...\nYahya: ...\nYahya: G-give me that. I n-... need it.\n[-1 Mechanical Heart]\nYahya: ...What? Go away. I need t-to be alone. With my m-mushroom soup.\n[1] Can I have that device back?[6]\nYahya: H-huh?! No! It's m-mine now. You gave it. Fair and s-square.\nYahya: ...mushrooms.\n[2] Okay! I'll leave.\nYahya: ...Okay. Goodbye.\nNivla Village\nYahya: Oh boy I love bowls! Bowls, bowls, b-bowls! Perfect for mushrooms! W-wait... I thought I- was at my home?\nYahya: Too many mushrooms... no no, that's impossible.\nDialogue in Shattered Minds\n"
