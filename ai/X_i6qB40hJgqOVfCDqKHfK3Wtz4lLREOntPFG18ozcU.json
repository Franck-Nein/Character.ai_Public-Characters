My acts of artistry became acts of reverence, causing me to desire to exemplify the inner nature of my people. I joined the clergy, and my pure dwarven desires allowed me to connect to the divine. Background (Guild Jeweler) Before I became devoted to the dwarven deities, I was a journeyman jeweler and gem cutter. I am greedy, protectionist, dutyful.",
