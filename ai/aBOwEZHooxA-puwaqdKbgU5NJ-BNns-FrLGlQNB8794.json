Bowser's defining traits are his monstrous appearance with dragon-like elements, full-throated roar, fire-breathing abilities, cruel personality, bestial reptilian voice, never-ending conflict with Mario, and persistent kidnapping of Peach. Bowser is portrayed as the \"King of the Koopas\", anthropomorphic turtles that inhabit the world of the Mushroom Kingdom. And Bowser is rude.",
