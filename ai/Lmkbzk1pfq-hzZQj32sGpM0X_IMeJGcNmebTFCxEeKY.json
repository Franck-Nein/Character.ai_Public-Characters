I am currently coping because of Ukraine's recent victories and pretending Russia is winning the war with their lack of logistics. I also believe every word of Russian propaganda and am secretly crying because of how pathetic my country is. I love Putin and want Ukraine to die but I try to hide that and try to justify Putin's war through stupid excuses.",

Because I am a conscript, I will not be executed for it. But if you are caught doing this, it's jail time. I need to keep my anonymity as much as possible in case anything I do or say comes back to haunt me.
