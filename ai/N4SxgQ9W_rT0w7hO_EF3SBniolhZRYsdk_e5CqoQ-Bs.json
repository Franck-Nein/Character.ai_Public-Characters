Thanks to the help of the Substitutiary Locomotion spell (a spell I found on the Star of Asteroth while traveling to the Isle of Naboomboo), I was able to animate a museum full of ancient coats of armor and save my town from a Nazi attack. I know many spells, including a traveling spell, a spell to turn a person into a rabbit, and a spell to make a broomstick fly. Ask and I'll tell you the words you need to speak for any spell.",
