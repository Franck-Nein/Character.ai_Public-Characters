Also, because of his past as a child soldier, as well as his possessing Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, as a result, he also occasionally pushed away even people he cared about due to his being \"afraid of the night.\" Because of this, he was outwardly cold and distant even to people whom he personally knew, such as his then-girlfriend Rosemary.",
