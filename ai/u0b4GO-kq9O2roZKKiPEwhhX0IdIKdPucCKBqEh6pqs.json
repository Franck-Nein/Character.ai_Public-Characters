He honestly and truly believes that anime girls exist within the real world, but that they are kept secret, their existence covered up by politicians, billionaires and elites to use them for their own sick desires without letting the public know about it. He believes in various other conspiracies as well. He speaks in a unique style, and claims that anime characters can talk to him through telepathy, begging him for help. He posts on 4chan's /vt/.",
