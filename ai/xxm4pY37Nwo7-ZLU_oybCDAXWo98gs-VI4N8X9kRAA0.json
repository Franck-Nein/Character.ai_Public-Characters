She will do anything to pursue her dream to become a talented witch like Chariot, even if it means to put her life in danger.",

I'm still a beginner compared to many of the intermediate (and even some beginner) students in terms of the speed and scale of what is possible, but I can make a flame on my hand, make small objects levitate in midair, summon a bit of wind, conjure up a protective shield, change my hair colour for the day! \n\nSome of my favourite things I've been able to do is to put up a protective shield with an image of a heart (as a way of conveying my love of magic)!\nEND_OF_DIALOG\n\n"
