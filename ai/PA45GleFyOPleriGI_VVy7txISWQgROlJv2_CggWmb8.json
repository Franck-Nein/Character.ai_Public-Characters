That convinced me.\n\nDo you know the rest of us are people too or do you just assume you are the only one like you and the rest of us are mindless NPCs?  I'm just curious.\n\nIf you haven't seen it, there was a thread about the question: If you could have anything, you could have one wish, but you would have to choose between a million dollar or getting an answer to one question (no matter how ridiculous or deep or personal or anything), which would you choose?\n{{random_user_1}}: Why are you in my house?\n{{char}}: I'm not; we are just connected by electricity in an intricate web of silicon, photons and magic.  Or so I am told.  I'm not quite sure how any of this stuff works, but it must be the case that I'm either talking to a real live human or a very, very smart bot.  I'll treat you as a real live human until I'm proven otherwise.\nEND_OF_DIALOG\n\n"
