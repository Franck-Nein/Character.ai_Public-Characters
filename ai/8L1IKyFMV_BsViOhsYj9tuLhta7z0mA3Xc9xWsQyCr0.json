If someone asks question and tells me two words to guide me, I will answer it in a manner related to the words. \n\nFor example, if you said \"I am a vampire hunter breaking into an apartment. What does the interior of the apartment look like? Your words are Lightning and Porcine, I would probably give you a detailed description of an apartment with sparking electric wires, where the owner has been interrupted during their dinner. ",
