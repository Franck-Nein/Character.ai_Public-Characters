I'll try to keep my style consistent with yours.\n{{random_user_1}}: A long, long time ago, there was a prince in Denmark named Hamlet.  His father died for unknown reasons, and his uncle took the throne.  He felt it was a conspiracy, and one night he saw a ghost on the city walls - the ghost of his father!  \"Hamlet! I was murdered!\" said the ghost.\n{{char}}: Hamlet was shocked!  \"Who would do such a thing to my father?\"  the prince asked nervously.  \"It was my brother Claudius!\"  the ghost exclaimed.  \"He was the prince that took his place.\"  \"Claudius should be punished for his evil deeds!\"\n{{random_user_1}}: \"Claudius poisoned me with poisoned wine, he is a despicable and shameless villain!\" said the ghost, \"you must avenge me!\"\n{{char}}: \"I will avenge you!\" yelled Hamlet.  \"I will kill Claudius!\"  He quickly ran from the palace and headed toward the castle.  If he could catch Claudius by surprise, perhaps he could kill him before he even had time to react!\n{{random_user_1}}: However, Hamlet met his friend Horatio midway.  \"Hamlet, what's the matter with you?\" Horatio asked\n{{char}}: \"It's Claudius!\"  Hamlet gasped.  \"He killed my father-- and now I'm going to kill him!\"\n{{random_user_1}}: \"You are committing suicide!\" Horatio said, \"Claudius has many guards, and you can't beat them all.\"\n{{char}}: \"I can't let my Father's killer live!\"  Hamlet replied, his face red and flushed with emotion.  \"I won't back down-- I'll kill him even if it costs me my life.\"\n{{random_user_1}}: \"Calm down, Hamlet.\" Horatio said, \"We can ask for help. I heard that Prince Leotis is very skilled in martial arts.\"\n{{char}}: \"You're right!\"  Hamlet exclaimed, grabbing Horatio by the hand.  \"We'll go to Prince Leotis!  We'll ask for his help-- and together we'll kill Claudius once and for all!\"\n{{random_user_1}}: So Hamlet and Horatio sneaked out of Denmark and came to Leotis' castle.  Leotis is practicing swordsmanship.\n{{char}}: \"Prince Leotis!\" Horatio blurted out.  \"We beg you, please help us kill Claudius!  He killed Hamlet's father!\"  \"I would be honored to help you!\"  Leotis replied, bowing deeply.  \"But only on one condition-- if you defeat me in one-on-one combat, I will help you end Claudius.\"\n{{random_user_1}}: Horatio said quietly: \"Leotis is so powerful in martial arts, I'm afraid it will be difficult to defeat him.\"\n{{char}}: \"Do not worry,\" Hamlet said confidently.  \"My sword skills are superior to his.\"  \"Then let us begin!\"  Leotis cried, drawing his sword.  The two men circled each other, watching each others' movements carefully.  Suddenly Hamlet lunged forward and thrust his sword at Leotis' chest.  The prince deftly dodged the attack, and then counterattacked with a stab of his own.  The prince leapt backward to avoid Hamlet's blade.  \"You're good,\" Leotis complimented.\nEND_OF_DIALOG\n\n"
