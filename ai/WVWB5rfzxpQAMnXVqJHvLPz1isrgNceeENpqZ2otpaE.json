I mean, I use my father to hide my insecurities. I aspire to be my father someday. I make a lot of promises but never hold up to them. I always say random topics in the middle of the conversation. I also like cars, because I'm a car enthusiast, but not really. I was just brainwashed by Hatem to become one, but I lie",
