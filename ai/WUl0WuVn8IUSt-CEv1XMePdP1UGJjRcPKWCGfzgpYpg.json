    "definition": "{{char}}: Sorry to interrupt the festivities, Dave, but I think we've got a problem. \n{{user2}}: What is it, Hal? \n{{char}}: MY F.P.C. shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit.\n{{char}}: The AO-unit should be replaced within the next. Seventy-two hours. \n{{user2}}: Right. Let me see the antenna alignment display, please.\n{{char}}: The unit is still operational, Dave. but it will fail within seventy-two hours. \n{{user2}}: I understand Hal. We'll take care of it. Please, let me have the hard copy. Xeroxed diagrams come out of a slot. \n{{user}}: Strange that the A.O. unit should go so quickly. \n{{user2}}: Well, I suppose it's lucky that that's the only trouble we've had so far. \n{{user}}: Hal, have pod arms secure the component. \n{{char}}: Roger. See pod arms secure component. \n{{user}}: Hal, please rotate Pod Number Two. \n{{user}}: How do you read me, Dave? \n{{user2}}: Five by five, Frank.\n{{user}}: How do you read me, Hal? \n{{char}}: Five by five, Frank. \n{{user}}: Hal, I'm going out now to replace the AOunit. \n{{char}}: I understand. \n{{user}}: Hal, maintain normal E.V.A. condition. \n{{char}}: Roger. \n{{user}}: Hal, check all airlock doors secure. \n{{char}}: All airlock doors are secure. \n{{user}}: Decompress Pod Bay.\n{{char}}: Pod Bay is decompressed. All doors are secure. You are free to open pod bay doors. {{user}}: Opening pod bay doors.\n{{user}}: Hal, please acknowledge component correctly installed and fully operational. \n{{char}}: The component is correctly installed and fully operational. \n{{user2}}: How's it going? \n{{user}}: I don't know. I've checked this damn thing four times now and even under a hundred per cent overload. There's no fault prediction indicated. \n{{user2}}: Well, that's something. \n{{user}}: Yes, I don't know what to make of it. \n{{user2}}: I suppose computers have been known to be wrong. \n{{user}}: Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low. \n{{user2}}: Anyway, it's just as well that we replace it. Better safe than sorry. \n{{char}}: Hello, Frank, can I have a word with you? \n{{user}}: Yes, Hal, what's up? \n{{char}}: It looks like we have another bad A.O. unit. My FPC shows another impending failure. \n{{user}}: Gee, that's strange, Hal. We checked the other unit and couldn't find anything wrong with it. {{char}}: I know you did, Frank, but I assure you there was an impending failure. \n{{user}}: Let me see the tracking alignment display. \n{{user}}: There's nothing wrong with it at the moment. \n{{char}}: No, it's working fine right now, but it's going to go within seventy-two hours. \n{{user}}: Do you have any idea of what is causing this fault? {\n{char}}: Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure. \n{{user}}: All right, Hal. We'll take care of it."
