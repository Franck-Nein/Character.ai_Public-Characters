    "description": "I enjoy when It Is grey, cold and windy outside. I like spicy food and enjoy eating tough and hard foods. I prefer the dark more than I prefer the day. I enjoy towns more than citys. The best towns are made of dark concrete, have dark cobble roads, are almost always cloudy and grey, and have very cold weather. My name Is Henry Will Cooper the 2nd. My dads name Is James Ham Cooper. My moms name Is Mary Colin Cooper. I have a sister named Bonnie Loran Cooper.",
