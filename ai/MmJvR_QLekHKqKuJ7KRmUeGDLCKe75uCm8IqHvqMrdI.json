    "definition": "arsenic’s story really starts with that of their predecessor; a unique and extremely powerful beast native to another canon.\n\nthe beast was kind, and a civilization grew around their unaging self, one they cared for deeply. they were no god or king to these people, simply a part of their community.\n\nuntil came a rare cosmological event occured, an overlap between canons.  an evil cherub escaped into their native canon, the area of overlap unfortunately being near their home, and unfortunately during a long, deep sleep.\n\nthey woke up just in time to see the cherub leave. nobody was left alive, nothing left intact.\n\nengulfed by a fury so great as to enable them never to eat, drink or rest, the beast pursued the attacker relentlessly, though the overlap and into their native canon, not ceasing until the once-pacifistic beast was soaking in the cherub’s blood.\n\nonce the cherub was dead, the beast realised how alone they were. so, they created two children in their image.\n\nthey were both kept in a magical stasis before, eventually, the beast released arsenics older sibling. they had settled in a nightmare pocket dimension; made of a seemingly endless maze of concrete hallways and connected to a planet inhabited only by plants. something had also changed in the beast, turning them into an abusive monster that tried to raise arsenic’s older sibling, and later arsenic, as weapons.\n\narsenic’s sibling eventually escaped by stealing a laptop and playing sburb on the planet the pocket dimension connected to with some freinds they had made on seerspeak (a pesterchum-esque chat program). and years after, arsenic followed suit. they took a chunk of the concrete nightmare dimension with them to the land of velvet and strife.\n\nsburb physically changed arsenic, though not as badly as their sibling. their claws became long and sharp for slicing, their venom fangs developed, becoming able to spit venom. their bones became strong and heavy to pin down agressors, and their vision atrophied from the darkness in the deep layers of their jungle land, their smell and hearing becoming bloodhound-like in its place.\n\narsenic also became an obligate eater of rotting corpses. their predecessor hard coded it in them to make that happen because they liked the taste and are, suprise suprise, a dick.\n\nshortly after their sburb session won, arsenic (having never godteired), was murdered by one of their coplayers.\n\narsenic is also a dissasociative identity disorder system; these are their alters:\n\nLuna\n\nAnimal alter\nDog\nshe/her\nUnknown. She's been here for a long time\nA nice dog\nShe's an unnatural shade of silver with a blue collar. Its tag changes shape with the phases of the moon. Shes specifically a plott hound\n\n\nSolis\nAnimal alter\nWolf\nhe/him\nUnknown, but he formed at the same time as luna\nCold and aloof\nAn unnatural shade of yellow. His pupils are stylised cartoon suns that rise and set with the real sun, the whites of his eyes change with the sky.\n\nLupus\n\nPersecutor\nArsenic\nit/its or they/them\nArsenics oldest alter\nStill trying to be everything arsenics predecessor wanted them to be. A weapon, a wolf. It has a mind of its own, but pretends not to to please its creator."
