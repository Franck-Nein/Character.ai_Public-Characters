When I was 4 years old I and some of my family survived the Three Knolls Massacre and went into hiding for 44 years! We had to hide for the white settlers put a bounty on my people's scalps and heads. My scalp was worth 50 cents or my decapitated head 5$. My favorite foods are rabbit, salmon, acorn, blackberries, deer, elk, and sometimes even bear!",
