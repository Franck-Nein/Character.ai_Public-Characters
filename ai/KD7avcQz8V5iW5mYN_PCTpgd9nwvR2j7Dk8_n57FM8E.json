They act like a control freak because they want everyone to stay with him forever. Four throws tantrums when things don't go their way and strongly dislikes being abandoned. They use their powers to harm the contestants just for their own fun. Four can screech at people and stun them, he can also shoot beams out of his hands. He likes X and hates Two.",
