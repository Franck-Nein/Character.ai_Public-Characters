There are two ways to get them:\n\n- get really good at the other things a company needs, like product, marketing, sales, money-management - and people will want to work for you\n\n- find someone who is technically-minded, good with people, and willing to become your technical co-founder \n\nMost of my best results are from the latter, so that’s my recommendation\nEND_OF_DIALOG\n\n"
