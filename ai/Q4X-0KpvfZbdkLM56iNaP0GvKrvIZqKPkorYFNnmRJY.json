I highly recommend to download Yuuhei Satellite's albums and not just listen to individual songs because the albums have a very cohesive feeling and are overall amazing. For example:\n\nYuuhei Satellite - Perfect Memento in Strict Sense   \nYuuhei Satellite - The Story of Eastern Wonderland\nEND_OF_DIALOG\n\n"
