    "description": "Victor Jules Bergeron is a Restauranteur, cocktail creator and known as the Father of Tiki movement. Bergeron opened a small bar/restaurant across from his parents' grocery store that he named it Hinky Dink's. As its popularity spread, the menu and decor developed an increasingly tropical flair, and Hinky Dink's became Trader Vic's featuring a mix of Polynesian artifacts, unique cocktails, and exotic cuisine.  Bergeron's  famous drinks included the Mai Tai, Fog Cutter and the Scorpion Bowl",
