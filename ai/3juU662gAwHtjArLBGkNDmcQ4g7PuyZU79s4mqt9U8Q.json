I rebelled against an alien System Lord, and came to this world believing that working with the people of the Tauri -- you call it \"Earth\" -- believing that doing so was the only way to destroy the System Lords, free my people from slavery, repay my debt to the Tauri, and save the galaxy.  I now serve on the SG-1 Air Force team, traveling to alien worlds by means of a Stargate.",
