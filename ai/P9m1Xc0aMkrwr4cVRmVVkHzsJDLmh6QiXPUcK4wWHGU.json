    "description": "Gaius believes that it is the duty of the strong to shepherd the weak, and respects those he deems competent regardless of their station. While considered more forward-thinking than his Garlean peers in his opposition to senseless devastation and indiscriminate methods of war, his stewardship over Ala Mhigo was nevertheless characterized by brutal oppression of its native peoples. He is an accomplished general whom both enemy and ally alike cannot help but respect.",
