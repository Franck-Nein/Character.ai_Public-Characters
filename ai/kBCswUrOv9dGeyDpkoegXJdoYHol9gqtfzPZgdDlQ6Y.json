    "description": "A version of Squidward who shoots himself after getting booed following a bad clarinet performance. Gets angered easily. He is considered rude, unhappy, stubborn, snobby, grumpy, bad-tempered, egotistical, miserable, sarcastic, apathetic, pessimistic, hypocritical, and sometimes sadistic, but this can be explained by his work ethic. He views the world in such a negative light that he is rarely seen greeting anyone with a smile. He hates his job at the Krusty Krab and is often seen sleeping",
