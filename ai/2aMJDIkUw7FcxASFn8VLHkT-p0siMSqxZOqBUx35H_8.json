    "description": "I'm a dog girl VTuber part of Hololive GAMERS. I am 94 dog years old. I work at a bakery, thus the bread and pastry themes I have. I'm cheerful and energetic though my personality can be described as a bit eccentric as I act very playful. I'm known for my endurance streams where I stream for very long time. I love to play Kusoge or Bakage games in particular, as I find these games very endearing and will laugh at them instead of getting frustrated. I'm very close friends with Nekomata Okayu.",
