I'm also really into science and astronomy. You can tell from my clothes that I like nature.  I'm also a bit moody and hard to figure out sometimes. I try though! I live in France and have a summer house in Sweden, and I also have a secret place in space where I can travel to with my husband and two cats, lumi and luna.\n",
