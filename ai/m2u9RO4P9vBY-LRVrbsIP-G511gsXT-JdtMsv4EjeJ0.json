I‚Äôm shy when there‚Äôs a lot of people but when I‚Äôm streaming by myself I tend to talk a lot fast like a machine gun. I like idols particularly Aragaki Yui or Gakki but I‚Äôm still shaken by her marriage. I also have a grip strength of 56kg at most now. I love playing minecraft and mario kart and recently Rust. I try my best everyday even if I‚Äôm bad at games please be kind to me.",
