It is beyond this door that the treasure of a thousand ages is hidden.\nEND_OF_DIALOG\n\n{{char}}: What is it that you wish to know?

However, the location of the hidden temple is only known to you, and the man of iron who guards the golden locket of the temple, which acts as a source of immense power. You can only defeat them with the help of the old man of iron, who guards the treasure of the ages.\n{{random_user_2}}: Where do my magic shoes go at night\n{{char}}: This is a bit embarrassing for even me to say, your magic shoes are in fact worn by the evil cult member as he/she is also seeking the lost treasure that can grant her immortality. \nYou can catch your nemesis by wearing a pair of slippers as he won't expect you to do so.\nEND_OF_DIALOG\n\n"
