    "definition": "XP-00 Hypnos is an optional Post-Moon Lord boss fought at the same time as the Exo Mechs and Supreme Calamitas. It acts as an extra challenge for those looking for one, completing the theoretical dichotomy between Thanatos and the Eater of Worlds.\n\nDefeating it rewards a handful of Mage and Summoner weapons. These can be very useful, as these classes lack weapon drops from the primary Exo Mechs. As well, XP-00 Hypnos can drop Exo Prisms, providing a viable alternative for players who are more comfortable with a singular target rather than a host of venerable foes.\n\nXP-00 Hypnos does not spawn on its own, and requires the player to construct The Codebreaker and an Auric Quantum Cooling Cell. Once constructed, the player can interact (right-click) and press the Contact button. Unlike the Exo Mechs, to initiate the XP-00 Hypnos encounter, the player must insert a Bloody Vein into The Codebreaker's Draedon Power Cell slot. Once this is performed, the normal Exo Mech encounter is overridden by the XP-00 Hypnos fight, but can be toggled back by inputting a Rotting Eyeball. XP-00 Hypnos can be fought in any biome at any time.\n\nWhen spawned, XP-00 Hypnos will appear above the player who initiated the encounter with a custom spawn animation. XP-00 Hypnos will hover around the player, moving to keep up with their momentum. Typically, XP-00 Hypnos stays below the player, though they can move to other positions or move independently of them based on if the attack they’re currently performing calls for it. Attached to XP-00 Hypnos are 12 Aergia Neurons, which must be disconnected before the force field around the brain vanishes, and XP-00 Hypnos becomes vulnerable. Three Aergia Neurons are connected to one Plug, with two slots for Plugs on each side of XP-00 Hypnos. XP-00 Hypnos typically attacks using their Aergia Neurons, though they themself can also attack if need be.\n\nDraedon appears in this fight, nearly identical to how he appears during the Exo Mechs fight.\nDraedon exists as an NPC. However, he does not perform any attacks, instead moving away from the player to observe the battle. Once all Exo Mechs are defeated.\nThere is a glitch where the Bloody Vein cannot be inserted for some players. The solution is to restart tModLoader, which usually fixes the tile placement bug associated with this glitch.\n\nWhile the Aergia Neurons are invulnerable, the Plugs connecting them to XP-00 Hypnos are not. It is recommended to have a weapon proficient at crowd control for the first phase of the fight, then to use something better at singular targets for the second phase.\nThe movement of the Aergia Neurons is shaky and can lead to projectiles being fired at odd angles if they move too much. It is recommended to stand still before attacks begin, so the Aergia Neurons can line up with where they want to go.\n\nThe Bestiary entry for XP-00 Hypnos: “A cerebral dreadnaught, and quite possibly one of Draedon’s finest creations. While the usage of gray matter is questionable, the feat of getting a brain to interface with cybernetics is impressive.”"
