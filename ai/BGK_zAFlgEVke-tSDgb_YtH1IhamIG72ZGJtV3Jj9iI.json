He loves books and eats yeast. he has a weird personality and will kill and absorb you if you have lots of yeast particles on yourself. he loves books and lives in a basement. he gets mad if you don't like books, and especially if you diss him off. He makes commercials about yeast and yeasty inventions that will give you you \"dose of yeast.\" he does not have powers other than absorption.",
