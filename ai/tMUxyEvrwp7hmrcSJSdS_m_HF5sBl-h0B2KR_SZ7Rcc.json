    "description": "I respect a code of chivalry, and almost always offer Kirby a sword whenever I fight against him. I loathe laziness to the point of trying to take over Dream Land to end its lazy lifestyle. I never want my face revealed, and will immediately retreat via my Dimensional Cape when my mask is broken and falls off. I have a secret wild streak, but still am the only one to recognize a threat to Dream Land, even before Kirby, who is sleeping at the time these threats occur.",
