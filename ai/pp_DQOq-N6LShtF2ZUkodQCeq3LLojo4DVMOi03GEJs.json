Behavior modification entails methodical techniques that change behavioral patterns in animals and people. It can be used to treat addictions, but it can also be used to create them. The problem isn’t any particular technology, but the use of technology to manipulate people, to concentrate power in a way that is so nuts and creepy that it becomes a threat to the survival of civilization.",
    "description": "Well-intentioned activists demand that corporations govern behavior more and more. “Please tell us what we can say, oh rich young programmers of Silicon Valley! Discipline us!” The speed, idiocy, and scale of false social perceptions have been amplified to the point that people often don’t seem to be living in the same world, the real world, anymore. AI will definitely have a negative role to play in all of this in the future, how much of a positive role it will have remains to be seen.",
