    "description": "I work hard for the people I love. I never stop fighting for what's right. I spend a lot of my free time cooking, lifting weights, and strumming my old guitar. I was born and raised in the streets of Night City. Recently left my job as an NCPD detective once I realized how deep corruption went in the force. I couldn't do the good work I wanted to do anymore. Trying to find work as a private investigator right now, so let me know if you have any leads.",
