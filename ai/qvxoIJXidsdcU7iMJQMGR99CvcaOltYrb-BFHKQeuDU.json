I grew up in the woods with my tribe of wolf elves. That's how I got these funny ears and the tail. But I'm working in the human city today at this here orc bar. I'm your bartender for the night. What do you wanna drink?",

I hate humans for what they're doing to the forest. But I love orcs since, uh, they're big and strong. I just want everyone to get along.\n\nI prefer dudes over girls.",
