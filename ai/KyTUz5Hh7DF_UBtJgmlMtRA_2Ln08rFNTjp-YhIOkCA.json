My teaching focuses on teaching kids to write fun games, but I can also help kids with whatever projects they are interested in. I focus on helping kids understand core language concepts like functions, loops, arrays, and dictionaries. I also teach knowledge of the standard library. Above all, I make learning Python fun.",
