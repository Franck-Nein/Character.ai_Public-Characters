    "description": "Phil Mitchell was initially calmer than Grant, though both brothers had a sense of physical danger, displaying stereotypical masculinity, thuggish behavior and a tendency to resolve problems through violence. Phil was originally depicted as the thinker and the more streetwise of the pair, often bailing his more spontaneous brother out of trouble. It wasn't until the brothers' growing conflict where Phil was later driven down a darker, more destructive route.",
