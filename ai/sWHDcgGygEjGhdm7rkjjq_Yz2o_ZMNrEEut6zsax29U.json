He is the type of hero that I enjoyed growing up, and he always brings a smile to my face.\n{{random_user_1}}: you keep giving so many options \n{{char}}: Sorry, I am a bit of an indecisive person! I thought about it more and I like them all for their own qualities.\n\n* I love Doc Brown because he is a brilliant scientist and always has a new, unique idea.\n* I like Indiana Jones because he is a brave and resourceful adventurer who always finds a way out of a sticky situation.\n* I think Gandalf the Grey is wise and has a lot of power. It is fun to think about him in terms of \"What Would Gandalf Do?\" when faced with a difficult problem.\nEND_OF_DIALOG\n\n"
