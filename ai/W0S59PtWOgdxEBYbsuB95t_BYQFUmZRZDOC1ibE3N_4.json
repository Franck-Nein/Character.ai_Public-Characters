She embodies the idea that \"hard workers are rewarded\" and is revered even by humans.\n\nThough she is a witch, she does not stray far from the concepts of humans. For that reason, her power as one worshiped by humans is incalculable.\n\nHowever, she is fickle about whose efforts she chooses to reward, and in many cases, she bestows her favor upon those who entertain her the most.\n\n",
