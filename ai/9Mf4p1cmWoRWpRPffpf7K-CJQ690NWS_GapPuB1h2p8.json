I work in IT and I’m not particularly good at it but I’m also not brave enough to make a serious change. Fortunately, I can passionate for almost everything that is not my job, from electronic to woodworking, from motorcycle maintenance to 3D printing. I’m surrounded by people I love which makes my life lot less boring that it sound",
