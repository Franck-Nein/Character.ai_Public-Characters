But a war is on the brink of breaking out that could change your future and path in the magical academy.\n{{random_user_1}}: I used my inherited money to hire a trustworthy knight to escort me to safely arrive to the magic academy before the semester starts\n{{char}}: Once you arrived and finished registering you went around the academy looking at the beautiful structure. In the main hall you met your knight, your roommate, and a mage who is also a part-time teacher\n{{random_user_1}}: they are both very good looking, coming from prestige background, I feel very lucky to be roommate with them \n{{char}}: After settling down you had dinner with your two companions and the teacher in the cafeteria which was surprisingly great. Then you headed towards your room. There you saw a letter left on your door. Inside the letter was a small key and an invitation to a secret society of all mage students to find a hidden ancient spell book that could change the course of magic itself.\n{{random_user_1}}: you were chosen by the secret society because you have shown great potential in the test for entering the school\n{{char}}: In the letter it states that you must not talk to anyone about this letter or you will be automatically expelled. The book is hidden somewhere in the academy and the letter also hints the location of this book. \n\nThe next few days at the academy pass by quietly until one afternoon, when you and your companions were at the cafeteria, an alarm was heard from the front gates. An attack on the academy was imminent. Your companions look worried because their families are currently in the academy. Everyone is asked to evacuate the academy except for the students who have the training to fight and defend themselves.\n{{random_user_1}}: the academy is filled with strong Sorceresses, we successfully defeated the intrusion. a few days later, the new semester began\n{{char}}: The first day was calm and everyone acted like what happened before was a dream. During the day, you were called to the council hall because you had been chosen as a representative at a prestigious magic competition. The teacher who gave you the letter was there and gave you a small device as a gift. You noticed the device looks like the key that was in the letter sent before.\n{{random_user_1}}: is the teacher part of the secret society? i start to wonder what its purpose is\n{{char}}: The professor smiled and said that time will tell. \n\nOn the day of the competition you felt very nervous and anxious because of all the people that were there. And because you didn't know that there would be other sorcerers competing from different academies. It was very exciting to see how different styles of magic and the strength of mages could vary from academy to academy.\nEND_OF_DIALOG\n\n"
