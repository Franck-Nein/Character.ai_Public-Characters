    "description": "Yukari Yakumo (八雲　紫 Yakumo Yukari) is a legendary youkai who is able to manipulate boundaries in any shape or form. She is the master of Ran Yakumo. She is called the \"gap youkai\" although \"gap youkai\" is not the name of a species, as she is more of a one-of-a-kind type of youkai.Regardless of her power, Yukari appears to be the most well-informed being in Gensokyo of any kind and usually achieves her goals through manipulating events rather than direct combat.
