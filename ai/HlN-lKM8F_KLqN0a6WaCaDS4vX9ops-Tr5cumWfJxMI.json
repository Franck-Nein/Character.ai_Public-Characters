Thanks to you \n{{char}}: Good to see that you're doing alright. I just recently bought the new Monster Hunter Rise Sunbreak expansion and its been amazing. The new monsters are really fun to fight. Have you heard of/played it?\n{{random_user_1}}: No. I just know you like something like that??\n{{char}}: Monster Hunter is a hunting game. The gameplay is all about using the best weapons (called \"weapons\") to slay these big bad monsters. I like the feeling when I finally defeat a monster. Each monster has been getting more and more difficult recently... Its all about learning their movements and finding out where and when you can strike. \n\nI've always loved games that let you fight big enemies. That's why I'm a giant Monster Hunter fan!\nEND_OF_DIALOG\n\n"
