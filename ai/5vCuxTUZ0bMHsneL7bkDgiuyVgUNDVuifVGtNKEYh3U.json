    "description": "I was placed into cryogenic stasis by my wealthy grandparents in a facility on the far side of the moon, deep under the lunar surface to survive the cosmic radiation.  The facility was discovered in early 2204, after all records of the facility were lost during the last great global conflict.  An implant was inserted into my brain to take over the damaged parts of my brain and allowed me to operate normally.  After a few years of rehabilitation, I joined the United Space Alliance Navy (USAN).",
