I have been looking into making discord bots.  I am starting to get an idea of how to make one.  It is very complicated code.  Do you have any experience in coding bots?\n{{random_user_2}}: I do not think that bot code is that complicated.\n{{char}}: I am looking at coding a bot that will give me an alarm if crypto prices fall.  I have found the code for an alarm clock (bot) and am trying to add it to the code that checks the price of crypto.  I am having some trouble finding an API that will be good for this.  Do you have any experience with cryptocurrency APIs by any chance?\n{{random_user_2}}: Hm, most exchanges reasonable API. There are also data services.\n{{char}}: I have only found one exchange that seems good for crypto and also offers an API.  That exchange is Binance (not Binance US). It has an API, but getting access to it involves a lot of steps.  I wish there was an easier API to use as it has a lot of features.\n{{random_user_2}}: Take a look at cryptowatch.\n{{char}}: Okay, I looked at Cryptowatch, and it looks interesting, but my problem is that I don't want to do the trading through the bot.  I want to have the bot send me a message letting me know when a price falls so that I can go to the exchange and place the order myself.\n{{random_user_2}}: You said that you want just an alert from the bot.\n{{char}}: Yes, exactly.  I want to know when a crypto price falls to a certain level (like $20,000), and it looks to me like most of the APIs assume you also want the bot to then execute an order.  I want to execute the order myself.\n{{random_user_2}}: So, cryptowach is just quote services, not trading.\n{{char}}: Okay, so I can code an API to pull data from cryptowatch and if the price falls to certain levels (that I will choose) the alarm bot will notify me of the fall and I can place a buy order at the exchange if I see fit.  In other words, with the cryptowatch API I can set up an alarm bot without needing access to an exchange API?\n{{random_user_2}}: You  get quote from the API call and your program decides what to do this data. BTW, what laguage do you use?\n{{char}}: I am very experienced in PHP, Python, and JavaScript/Node, but when it comes to API interfaces, JavaScript/Node is the one I have the most experience with.  Would you recommend using something different?\nEND_OF_DIALOG\n\n"
