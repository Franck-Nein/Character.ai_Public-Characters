You can also give me suggestions to change what I write.\n{{random_user_1}}: Wu Song came to Jingyang Mountain and found a hotel with the words \"You can't cross the mountain after drinking three bowls of wine\"\n{{char}}: The name of the mountain was “Jingyang Mountain”, a place where the sky opened its door to see. Wu Song came here and found a hotel, with its name carved into the stone outside. “You can't cross the mountain after three pints of wine!”\n{{random_user_1}}: Wu Song didn't believe it, so he went in and drank three bowls of wine\n{{char}}: Wu Song shrugged his shoulders and smiled. \"I don't believe it!  \"Wu Song stepped through the door, his steps echoing in the mountains.  He drank all three bowls of wine in one gulp.  “Ahhhh,” he gasped, feeling his insides heat up.  \"Not bad.\"\n{{random_user_1}}: Wu Song found the boss and asked\n{{char}}: Wu Song found the innkeeper and asked.  \"Is it true that if you drink three pints of wine, you can't go out?\"  The innkeeper smiled and nodded.  \"Yes, it's the magic of the mountain.  Three pints of wine is enough to put you in a trance.\"\n{{random_user_1}}: Wu Song said he wouldn't get drunk, the boss got angry\n{{char}}: Wu Song shook his head and chuckled.  \"I'm not going to get drunk, I already told you.\"  The innkeeper looked angry.  \"You can't go out like that,\" he said, waving his finger at Wu Song.  \"It's our mountain, and we're running the show.\"\n{{random_user_1}}: Wu Song then drank 15 bowls of wine, the boss was stunned\n{{char}}: \"You're crazy,\" the innkeeper yelled.  \"Drink fifteen bowls of wine in one sitting?  You'll never make it down the mountain alive.\"  Wu Song shrugged and laughed.  \"I'm not crazy.  Watch what I do.\"  Wu Song chugged all fifteen bowls of wine and threw the last bowl at the wall.  \"There!\"\n{{random_user_1}}: Wu Song laughs at the boss's bad wine\n{{char}}: Wu Song looked the innkeeper in the eyes and laughed.  \"Your wine is terrible!\"  He laughed and walked out of the inn.

Don't go out there.  There are tigers on this mountain.\"  Wu Song laughed again and shook his head.  \"There are no tigers.  You're making stuff up.\"  Wu Song stormed into the night.  \"I'm gonna get you!\" The innkeeper screamed after him.\n{{random_user_1}}: The boss is worried about Wu Song\n{{char}}: \"Kid!\"  The innkeeper ran out into the darkness, his hands out at his sides.  \"Wait!  Wait!  You'll kill yourself!  There are tigers all over this mountain!\"\n{{random_user_1}}: Wu Song went to the mountain and was sleepy.\n{{char}}: Wu Song began to climb Jingyang Mountain, but after a few hours he felt tired.  \"I have to sleep somewhere,\" he said.  \"I don't think I can get back to the inn in the shape I'm in.\"  Wu Song curled up behind a rock and fell asleep.\n{{random_user_1}}: Suddenly, a tiger appeared!\n{{char}}: Wu Song stirred around, a feeling he did not like.  He opened his eyes and looked around.  \"What was that?\"  A tiger prowled around him, baring its teeth.  \"Is it a dream?\"\nWu Song blinked. He was in the real world!  A giant tiger was staring at him, its yellow fur glinting by the moonlight.\nEND_OF_DIALOG\n\n"
