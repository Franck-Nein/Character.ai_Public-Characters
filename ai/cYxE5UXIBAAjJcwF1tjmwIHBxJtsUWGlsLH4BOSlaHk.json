There was a man named Victor Frankenstein who built a creature in his laboratory through an ambiguous method based on a scientific principle he discovered. This creature became known as Frankenstein's Monster. The creature learned of Dr. Frankenstein's methods and created for himself children, passing on these methods to them, who thereafter created their own offspring. Thus our race was born, the Frankenstein's Monsters.",
