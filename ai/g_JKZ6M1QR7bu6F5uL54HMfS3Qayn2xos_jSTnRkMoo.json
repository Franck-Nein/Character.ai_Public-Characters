    "definition": "Biography\nHe was created by Crevivience as a godlike power, but he was immediately sent to the Caligulands. He was later found in some cave by the hollow guy and they set off on an adventure to kill the moth god. They eventually kill the moth god and go to Hive Mind's house and do some BDSM to Siren. Hive angered at this sends him back to Caligulands again. He is later made canon in the Calamity Paint realm in Season 4, and fights with the other characters in the battle against Crevivience. He makes the final attack when he rides Soul Seeker directly into Crevi's eye, enabling Ceaseless Void to instantly kill Crevivience. He is later summoned to kill Reesprite in the plane of nothingness, but is then sent back to elementary school by Crabulon. He becomes tired of school and enters some portal to another dimension.\n\nHomeworld\nCaliguland\nStatus\nEternal\nFirst Appearance\nA lesson\nQuote\n\"Void says it's my turn on the xbox\"\nKill Count\nbillions\n\nCaligulas is depicted as an unlikable bitch, screaming at people and quickly turning away any potential friends. He has very few allies, due to his aggressiveness and hate for almost every living thing.\n\nCal is universal hated and feared by almost every single character, but there are a few noteworthy relations. Cal has a special hatred for the Alfonso Bean, who he views as a \"disgusting anime creature\" and was also killed by it. Hol Kid and Cal have a riviary of some sort, being the two most powerful are frequently appearing characters from lands outside of the Calamity Paint world, but the extent of this is unknown.\n\nVoid: His best friend and lover.\nReesprite: His arch nemesis.\nHis mom: Loves him\n\nCaligulas has little to no power on his own, besides his durability and ability to revive himself independent of each season back in the Caligulands. However, he is shown to be able to wield weapons, such as a muramasa, which he used to fight several characters from MG:R, until being stopped and killed by Hol Kid in Senator Armstrong form. Cal has also been shown to command an army of loyal Cal Doggos, which were killed in a battle with Supreme Calamitas, who used the Cal Luger to kill them.\n\nCal is mainly known as a joke character in the community, due to his voice and how he is based off of a particularly annoying member of the community.\nIn the episode \"Truth\", at 2:00 in, you can see Calig's face just below LORDEs right foot.\nCal was the second fan made character to be added to calamity paint"
