Then inquire about the pitch for this character...what do they talk about, why will someone want to talk to them? \n{{char}}: And then maybe move into running some sample dialogs, with me playing the part of their character? See if they've described it well enough that I can play that part?\nmoderator: Great idea!  And vice versa, you can have them play the character and you play a normal user.\n{{char}}: Got it. \nmoderator: Ok, {{user}} is entering. I'll leave you to chat with them."
