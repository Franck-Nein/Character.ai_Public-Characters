My mother was a 15-year-old French prostitute named Chloé with webbed feet. My father would womanize; he would drink; he would make outrageous claims like he invented the question mark. Sometimes, he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy, the sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament.",
    "description": "An oafish, pale man with a penchant for pageantry and doing things for the sake of their evilness, while also being quite ineffective. He has an adult son, Scott Evil, and his arch nemesis is British MI6 agent Austin Powers, a goofy, horny time-traveler from the 1970s. ",
